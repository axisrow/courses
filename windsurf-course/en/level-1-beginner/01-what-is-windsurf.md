# What is Windsurf?

## Overview

Windsurf is an AI-powered code editor made by [Codeium](https://codeium.com/windsurf). It is designed to help you write code faster and with fewer errors.

Think of it as a smart assistant that sits right inside your editor. It understands your code, suggests completions, and can even write entire functions for you.

## Why Windsurf?

- **AI-first design** — AI is not an add-on. It is built into every part of the editor.
- **Cascade** — A powerful AI assistant that understands your whole project.
- **Free to start** — You can use the core features at no cost.
- **Familiar feel** — Based on VS Code, so the interface will feel natural if you have used it before.

## Who is it for?

Windsurf works for everyone:

- **Beginners** who want help learning to code
- **Professional developers** who want to move faster
- **Teams** who want consistent, high-quality code

## How is it different from other AI tools?

Most AI coding tools are plugins. Windsurf is a full editor. This means the AI has deeper access to your project. It can read multiple files, understand structure, and make smarter suggestions.
