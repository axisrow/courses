# Your First Project

## Goal

In this lesson, you will create a simple Python project with AI help.

## Step 1: Create a Folder

1. Open Windsurf
2. Click **File → Open Folder**
3. Create a new folder called `my-first-project`
4. Open it

## Step 2: Create a File

1. In the Explorer, click the **New File** icon
2. Name it `app.py`

## Step 3: Write Code with AI

Type the following comment and press Enter:

```python
# Create a simple calculator that adds two numbers
```

Wait a moment. Windsurf will suggest code. Press **Tab** to accept.

You should get something like:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Result: {add(num1, num2)}")
```

## Step 4: Run Your Code

1. Open the terminal with `Ctrl+` `
2. Type: `python app.py`
3. Enter two numbers when asked
4. See the result!

## Step 5: Extend with AI

Try typing another comment:

```python
# Add subtract, multiply, and divide functions
```

Watch how Windsurf generates all four functions for you.

## What You Learned

- How to create a project in Windsurf
- How to use comments to guide AI code generation
- How to run code from the built-in terminal

## Practice

Try creating a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Start with a comment describing what you want.
