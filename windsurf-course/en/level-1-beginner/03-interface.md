# Interface Overview

## Main Areas

Windsurf looks similar to VS Code. Here are the key areas:

### 1. Activity Bar (Left Side)
The vertical bar on the left with icons:
- **Explorer** — browse your files
- **Search** — find text across your project
- **Source Control** — Git integration
- **Extensions** — install add-ons
- **Cascade** — the AI assistant panel

### 2. Editor Area (Center)
This is where you write code. You can:
- Open multiple files in tabs
- Split the view horizontally or vertically
- See AI suggestions inline as you type

### 3. Sidebar (Right or Left)
Shows details for the selected activity. For example, the file tree when Explorer is active.

### 4. Bottom Panel
- **Terminal** — run commands
- **Problems** — see errors and warnings
- **Output** — logs from extensions

### 5. Cascade Panel
This is unique to Windsurf. You can open it by:
- Clicking the Cascade icon in the Activity Bar
- Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+L` (Mac)

## Command Palette

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette. From here you can access any feature by typing its name.

Go to **File → Preferences → Settings** to customize:
- Font size
