# Daily Workflow Examples

## Putting It All Together

Now that you understand integrations, tasks, and voice — let's see how real people use Sentient day to day.

## Example 1: Morning Briefing

**Setup:** Create a recurring task that runs at 7:00 AM every weekday.

**What it does:**
1. Reads your Gmail inbox for new messages.
2. Checks your Google Calendar for today's events.
3. Looks up the weather via AccuWeather.
4. Sends you a Slack message with a summary.

**Prompt:** "Every weekday at 7 AM, summarize my unread emails, today's calendar events, and the weather forecast, then post it to my Slack #daily channel."

## Example 2: Meeting Notes

**How:** After a meeting, open Sentient and say:

"I just finished a meeting about Q3 marketing. Key decisions: increase social media budget by 20%, hire a content writer by March, launch campaign April 1."

Sentient will:
- Store this as a memory.
- Optionally create a Google Doc with the notes.
- Create Google Tasks for each action item.

## Example 3: Research Assistant

**How:** Ask Sentient:

"Research the top 5 competitors in the AI assistant space. Create a Google Sheet comparing their features, pricing, and user reviews."

Sentient's swarm task will:
1. Search the web for competitors.
2. Gather information from multiple sources.
3. Create and populate a Google Sheet.

## Example 4: Email Triage

**Setup:** A triggered task: "When I receive an email with 'urgent' in the subject, summarize it and send me a push notification."

This runs in the background. You never miss an important email again.

## Example 5: Weekly Planning

**Setup:** Recurring task every Sunday at 6 PM.

"Review my calendar for next week, identify conflicts, suggest an optimized schedule, and create a Google Doc with the plan."

## Tips for Effective Workflows

1. **Start simple** — One integration, one task. Build from there.
2. **Check task history** — Review results to refine your prompts.
3. **Use memories** — The more context Sentient has, the better its suggestions.
4. **Combine types** — Use triggered tasks for urgent items, recurring for routine ones.

## Summary

Sentient shines when you combine chat, integrations, and tasks into personalized workflows. The examples above are just starting points — your creativity is the limit.
