# What Is Sentient?

## Welcome!

Sentient is a free, open-source **personal AI assistant**. Think of it as a smart helper that lives on your computer or in the cloud and can chat with you, manage your calendar, read your emails, and even control other apps on your behalf.

## Why Does It Exist?

Most of us spend hours on repetitive tasks — checking emails, scheduling meetings, organizing files. Sentient's goal is to handle that busywork so you can focus on what truly matters.

## Key Ideas

- **Open-source** — Anyone can inspect, modify, and improve the code. Your data stays yours.
- **Personal** — Sentient learns *your* preferences and habits over time.
- **Proactive** — It doesn't just answer questions; it can suggest actions, remind you of deadlines, and plan your day.

## What Can It Do Right Now?

## How Is It Different from ChatGPT or Siri?

Sentient is **not** a product from a big tech company. It is community-built, fully transparent, and designed to be self-hosted. You choose the AI model it uses, and no data leaves your machine unless you want it to.

## Summary

Sentient is your open-source, privacy-first AI assistant that learns about you and automates daily tasks. In the next lesson, we'll explore how Sentient is built under the hood.
