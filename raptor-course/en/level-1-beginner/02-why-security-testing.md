## Why Security Testing Matters

### The Problem

Software is everywhere — in your phone, your car, your hospital, and your bank. When software has security flaws, attackers can:

- Steal personal data
- Take control of systems
- Disrupt critical services
- Demand ransom payments

### Traditional Approach

Security testing used to be entirely manual. A human expert would read code line by line, looking for mistakes. This is slow, expensive, and doesn't scale.

### The Modern Approach

Tools like RAPTOR automate much of this work:

- **Static analysis** reads your source code without running it
- **Fuzzing** runs your program with random inputs to find crashes
- **AI analysis** uses large language models to reason about vulnerabilities

### Where RAPTOR Fits

RAPTOR combines all three approaches into a single framework. You point it at your code, and it orchestrates multiple tools to find, verify, and help fix security issues.

### Key Takeaway

Security testing is not optional — it's essential. RAPTOR makes it accessible by automating the hard parts while keeping humans in the loop for decisions.
