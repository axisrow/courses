## What Is RAPTOR?

RAPTOR stands for **Recursive Autonomous Penetration Testing and Observation Robot**. It is an open-source security research framework that helps you find vulnerabilities in software automatically.

### Why Does It Matter?

Every piece of software can have bugs. Some bugs are just annoying — others can be exploited by attackers. RAPTOR helps security teams discover these dangerous bugs before the bad guys do.

### Who Made It?

RAPTOR was created by Gadi Evron, Daniel Cuthbert, Thomas Dullien (Halvar Flake), Michael Bargury, and John Cartwright. It is built on top of **Claude Code**, an AI coding assistant by Anthropic.

### What Can RAPTOR Do?

In simple terms, RAPTOR can:

1. **Scan** your code for known vulnerability patterns
2. **Fuzz** your programs by throwing random data at them to find crashes
3. **Analyze** findings using AI to understand how serious they are
4. **Generate exploits** — proof that a bug is real and dangerous
5. **Suggest patches** — code fixes to close the holes

### Key Takeaway

Think of RAPTOR as an automated security researcher that never sleeps. It combines traditional security tools with modern AI to make vulnerability discovery faster and more thorough.
