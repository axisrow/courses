## Generating Exploit Proof-of-Concepts

### Why Generate Exploits?

Finding a vulnerability is one thing. **Proving** it can be exploited is another. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrates that a bug is genuinely dangerous, not just theoretical.

### The `/exploit` Command

```
/exploit
```

This tells RAPTOR to generate working exploit code for discovered vulnerabilities.

### What RAPTOR Generates

For each exploitable finding, RAPTOR produces:

- **Compilable exploit code** (usually in C or Python)
- **Step-by-step explanation** of how the exploit works
- **Required conditions** — What needs to be true for the exploit to succeed
- **Impact description** — What an attacker could achieve

### Quality by Provider

| Provider | Exploit Quality | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Anthropic Claude | ✅ Compilable C code | Best results |
| OpenAI GPT-4 | ✅ Compilable C code | Strong alternative |
| Google Gemini | ✅ Compilable C code | Good quality |
| Ollama (local) | ❌ Often broken | Use for analysis only |

### The Exploit Feasibility Package

RAPTOR's `exploit_feasibility` package evaluates whether a vulnerability can realistically be exploited in practice, considering:

- Memory protections (ASLR, DEP, stack canaries)
- Required access level
- Network conditions
- Target environment

### Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Exploit generation is for **defensive purposes only** — to prove that a bug needs fixing. Never use generated exploits against systems you don't own or have permission to test.

### Key Takeaway

PoC exploits prove that bugs are real threats. RAPTOR generates them automatically, but always use this capability responsibly and ethically.
