# Introduction to LangChain

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions that make it easy to connect LLMs with external data sources, APIs, and other components.

## Why Use LangChain?

- **Simplicity**: Build complex LLM apps with just a few lines of code.
- **Modularity**: Mix and match components like prompts, models, and memory.
- **Ecosystem**: Hundreds of integrations with popular services and tools.
- **Community**: Active development and growing community support.

## Core Concepts

LangChain is built around several key ideas:

1. **Models** — Wrappers for LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. **Prompts** — Templates for structuring input to models
3. **Chains** — Sequences of calls to models and other components
4. **Memory** — Storing conversation history
5. **Agents** — LLMs that decide which tools to use
6. **Retrieval** — Fetching relevant data from external sources

## LangChain Ecosystem

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `langchain-core` | Base abstractions and LCEL |
| `langchain` | Chains, agents, retrieval |
| `langchain-community` | Third-party integrations |
| `langserve` | Deploy chains as REST APIs |
| `langsmith` | Debugging and monitoring |

## What You Will Learn

In this course, you will go from zero to building production-ready LLM applications. We start with basics and progress to advanced topics like RAG, agents, and deployment.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we will set up our development environment and install LangChain.
