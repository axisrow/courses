# Understanding the Output

## What v0 Gives You

When you enter a prompt, v0 generates several things:

1. **A live preview** — a visual rendering of your UI that you can interact with
2. **The code** — the actual source code (React + Tailwind CSS) behind the design
3. **A conversation** — you can keep chatting with v0 to refine the result

## The Preview Panel

The preview shows your generated UI exactly as it would look on a real website. You can:

- Click buttons and links to test interactions
- Resize the preview to see how it looks on mobile, tablet, or desktop
- Toggle between light and dark mode (if applicable)

## The Code Panel

Even if you're not a developer, it's useful to know what's there:

- v0 generates code using **React** (a popular framework) and **Tailwind CSS** (a styling system)
- You don't need to understand the code to use v0
- If you do know some code, you can edit it directly

## Iterating on Your Design

The best part of v0 is the conversation. After the first result, you can say things like:

- "Make the button bigger"
- "Change the background to light gray"
- "Add a phone number field"
- "Make it look more modern"

Each message refines the previous result. It's like having a conversation with a designer.

## Versions

v0 keeps track of each version. You can go back to a previous version if you don't like the latest changes. Look for version indicators in the interface.

## Summary

v0 gives you a live preview and working code. You can keep refining by chatting with the AI. Don't be afraid to experiment — you can always go back. Next, we'll explore Design Mode for visual editing.
