# Editing with Design Mode

## What is Design Mode?

Design Mode is a visual editor built into v0. Instead of writing prompts or code, you can click on elements and change them directly — like using a simple design tool.

## How to Enter Design Mode

1. Generate a UI with a prompt (or open an existing project)
2. Look for the "Design Mode" or "Edit" button in the toolbar
3. Click it — the preview becomes editable

## What You Can Do in Design Mode

### Change Text
Click on any text to edit it. Type your own headline, description, or button label.

### Adjust Colors
Select an element and change its background color, text color, or border color using a color picker.

### Resize Elements
Drag edges of elements to make them bigger or smaller.

### Move Things Around
Drag and drop elements to rearrange the layout.

### Change Fonts and Sizes
Select text and adjust the font family, size, weight (bold/regular), and spacing.

## When to Use Design Mode vs. Prompts

| Task | Use Design Mode | Use Prompts |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Fix a typo | ✅ | |
| Change one color | ✅ | |
| Add a new section | | ✅ |
| Rearrange entire layout | | ✅ |
| Fine-tune spacing | ✅ | |

## Tips

- Design Mode is great for small tweaks after the AI generates your base layout
- For big structural changes, go back to the chat and describe what you want
- Changes in Design Mode are saved automatically

## Summary

Design Mode lets you visually edit your UI without writing prompts or code. Use it for fine-tuning after the AI does the heavy lifting. Next, we'll look at templates — pre-made starting points.
