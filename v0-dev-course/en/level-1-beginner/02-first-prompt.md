# Creating Your First Prompt

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is simply a text description of what you want to build. You type it into v0.dev, and the AI turns your words into a real interface.

## Step-by-Step: Your First Prompt

1. Open [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) in your browser
2. Sign in with your Vercel account (or create one for free)
3. Find the text input area — it says something like "What do you want to build?"
4. Type your first prompt. Try something simple:

> Create a simple contact form with name, email, and message fields

5. Press Enter or click the Send button
6. Wait a few seconds — v0 will generate your UI

## Tips for Your First Prompt

- **Be specific** — "a contact form" is better than "a form"
- **Mention colors if you care** — "with a blue submit button"
- **Describe the layout** — "two columns" or "centered on the page"
- **Keep it simple at first** — you can always refine later

## Example Prompts to Try

- "A login page with email and password fields"
- "A pricing table with three plans: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise"
- "A simple to-do list app with add and delete buttons"
- "A restaurant menu with categories and prices"

## What Happens Next?

After v0 generates your UI, you'll see a live preview. You can:
- View the result
- Ask v0 to make changes by typing follow-up messages
- Copy the code
- Deploy it as a live website

## Summary

Writing a prompt is as easy as describing what you want. Start simple, and don't worry about getting it perfect — you can always refine. Next, we'll learn how to understand what v0 gives you back.
