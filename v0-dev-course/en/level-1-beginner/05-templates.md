# Using Templates

## What Are Templates?

Templates are pre-built designs that you can use as a starting point. Instead of building everything from scratch, you pick a template and customize it to fit your needs.

## Where to Find Templates

1. Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Browse the template gallery or community-shared projects
3. Filter by category: landing pages, dashboards, e-commerce, blogs, etc.

## How to Use a Template

1. Browse and find a template you like
2. Click on it to preview
3. Click "Use this template" or "Fork"
4. The template opens in your editor
5. Customize it with prompts or Design Mode

## Popular Template Categories

- **Landing pages** — great for businesses and products
- **Dashboards** — data displays and admin panels
- **E-commerce** — product listings and shopping carts
- **Portfolios** — personal websites to showcase work
- **Blog layouts** — article pages and content sites
- **Forms** — sign-up, contact, and survey forms

## Customizing a Template

Once you've opened a template, you can:

- Change all text and images
- Adjust colors to match your brand
- Add or remove sections
- Modify the layout
- Use chat prompts like: "Change this template to be about a yoga studio"

## Templates vs. Starting from Scratch

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Template | You want something fast and don't need a unique layout |
| From scratch | You have a very specific vision in mind |

## Summary

Templates save you time by giving you a professional starting point. Pick one, customize it, and you're ready to publish. This completes Level 1! In Level 2, you'll learn how to write better prompts and work with components.
