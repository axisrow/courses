# What is v0.dev?

## Introduction

v0.dev (now at v0.app) is a free AI-powered tool made by Vercel. It lets you build websites, web applications, and user interfaces just by describing what you want in plain English. No coding experience needed.

Think of it as talking to a designer and developer at the same time. You type something like "create a landing page for a coffee shop" — and v0 builds it for you in seconds.

## Why Should You Care?

- **No coding required** — you describe, AI builds
- **Fast** — get a working page in under a minute

- And much more

## How Does It Work?

1. You go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. You type a description (called a "prompt")
