# Building Full Applications

## From Components to Complete Apps

You've learned to create components, pages, and connect services. Now it's time to combine everything into a full, working application.

## Project Planning

Before you start building, answer these questions:

1. **What does the app do?** (e.g., "a booking system for a hair salon")
2. **Who uses it?** (e.g., "salon owners and their clients")
3. **What are the main features?** (e.g., "book appointments, view schedule, manage services")
4. **What data needs to be stored?** (e.g., "appointments, clients, services, prices")

## Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Define Your Pages
List all the pages your app needs:
- Home / Landing page
- Login / Sign up
- Dashboard
- Detail pages
- Settings

### Step 2: Build the Core Feature First
Don't try to build everything at once. Start with the most important feature and get it working.

### Step 3: Add Supporting Features
Once the core works, add secondary features one by one.

### Step 4: Connect the Data
Set up your database and API connections.

### Step 5: Polish the Design
Apply your design system, fix spacing, and test on mobile.

### Step 6: Deploy
Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.

## Example: Building a Recipe App

1. Prompt: "Create a recipe sharing app where users can add, browse, and save recipes"
2. v0 builds the main pages and database schema
3. Refine: "Add a search bar and category filters"
4. Refine: "Add user profiles with saved recipes"
5. Deploy and share

## Summary

Full applications are built step by step. Plan first, start with the core feature, then expand. v0 handles the technical complexity while you focus on what your app should do.
