# Best Practices & Tips

## Prompt Writing

- ✅ Be specific and descriptive
- ✅ Include style, colors, and layout preferences
- ✅ Break complex projects into smaller prompts
- ❌ Don't write vague one-word prompts
- ❌ Don't ask for everything in a single message

## Project Organization

- Start every project with a clear plan
- Define your design system early
- Use consistent naming for pages and components
- Keep your GitHub repository organized

## Design Tips

- Less is more — clean designs perform better
- Ensure your text is readable (good contrast, appropriate font sizes)
- Always test on mobile — most users browse on phones
- Use whitespace generously — don't cram elements together

## Performance

- Optimize images (use compressed formats)
- Don't add unnecessary features — every feature adds complexity
- Test your deployed site's loading speed

## Collaboration

- Use GitHub for team collaboration
- Share v0 project links with stakeholders for feedback
- Document your design decisions

## Security

- Never put API keys in your code — use environment variables
- Use authentication for pages that need it
- Keep your dependencies updated

## Staying Up to Date

- v0 is evolving rapidly — new features are added regularly
- Follow Vercel's blog and announcements
- Experiment with new features as they launch
- Join the v0 community for inspiration and tips

## Final Tips

1. **Start small** — build simple projects first, then increase complexity
2. **Iterate often** — don't aim for perfection on the first try
3. **Learn by doing** — the more you use v0, the better your prompts become
4. **Have fun** — building things should be enjoyable!
