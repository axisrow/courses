# Writing Better Prompts

## Why Prompt Quality Matters

The better your prompt, the closer the result will be to what you imagine. A vague prompt gives a generic result. A detailed prompt gives exactly what you need.

## The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

A good prompt includes:

1. **What** — what type of page or component
2. **Who** — who is it for (audience)
3. **Style** — visual style or mood
4. **Details** — specific elements, colors, layout

### Example: Weak vs. Strong

❌ Weak: "Make a website"

✅ Strong: "Create a landing page for a pet grooming business. Use soft pastel colors (pink and light blue). Include a hero section with a photo placeholder, a list of services with icons, customer testimonials, and a booking form. Modern, friendly style."

## Prompt Formulas

### Formula 1: Role + Task + Style
> "Design a [type] for [audience] in a [style] style"

Example: "Design a dashboard for a fitness app in a clean, minimal style"

### Formula 2: Page + Sections + Details
> "Create a [page type] with [section 1], [section 2], [section 3]. Use [colors]. Make it [adjective]."

Example: "Create a pricing page with three tiers, a comparison table, and an FAQ section. Use dark theme. Make it professional."

## Refining with Follow-ups

After the first result, use follow-up prompts to refine:

- "Move the testimonials above the pricing"
- "Make the header sticky"
- "Add animation to the hero section"
- "Use the Inter font"

## Common Mistakes

- Being too vague: "make it nice" — nice how?
- Asking for too much at once — break complex projects into steps
- Forgetting mobile: add "make it responsive" if important to you

## Summary

Better prompts = better results. Be specific about what, who, style, and details. Refine in follow-up messages. Practice makes perfect.
