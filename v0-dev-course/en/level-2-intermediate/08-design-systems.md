# Design Systems

## What is a Design System?

A design system is a set of rules for how your project looks: colors, fonts, spacing, button styles, and more. It keeps everything consistent.

Think of it like a brand guideline — it ensures your website looks unified, not like random pages stitched together.

## Design Systems in v0

v0 lets you define a design system that applies across your projects:

- **Colors** — primary, secondary, accent, background, text
- **Typography** — font families, sizes, headings
- **Spacing** — padding and margins
- **Border radius** — rounded or sharp corners
- **Shadows** — subtle or dramatic depth effects

## How to Set Up a Design System

1. Open your project settings in v0
2. Look for the "Design System" or "Theme" section
3. Define your brand colors (e.g., primary: #2563EB)
4. Choose your fonts (e.g., Inter for body, Poppins for headings)
5. Set spacing and corner styles

## Using Your Design System in Prompts

Once set, you can reference it:

- "Create a button using my primary color"
- "Build a card component following my design system"
- The AI will automatically apply your defined styles

## Why Bother?

| Without Design System | With Design System |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Every page looks different | Consistent brand look |
| You repeat color codes | Colors are predefined |
| Hard to maintain | Easy to update globally |

## Summary

A design system keeps your project visually consistent. Set it up once, and v0 applies it everywhere. Next: connecting your project to GitHub.
