# Deploying to Vercel

## What Does "Deploy" Mean?

Deploying means making your project available on the internet with a real URL that anyone can visit. Before deployment, only you can see your work.

## One-Click Deploy with Vercel

v0 is made by Vercel, so deployment is seamless:

1. Open your project in v0
2. Click the "Deploy" or "Publish" button
3. v0 deploys your project to Vercel's servers
4. You get a live URL (e.g., `your-project.vercel.app`)

That's it. Your website is live.

## Custom Domains

Want your own domain (e.g., `www.mybusiness.com`)?

1. Buy a domain from any registrar (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. Go to your Vercel dashboard
3. Add the domain to your project
4. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed
5. Your site is now live at your custom address

## What Happens After Deployment?

- Your site is live and accessible worldwide
- It's fast — Vercel uses a global CDN (content delivery network)
- It's secure — HTTPS is enabled automatically
- Every new change you deploy creates a new version

## Free vs. Paid
