# Connecting to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform where developers store and manage code. Think of it as Google Drive, but for code. It tracks every change and lets teams collaborate.

## Why Connect v0 to GitHub?

- **Backup** — your code is safely stored
- **Collaboration** — share with team members or developers
- **Version control** — track all changes over time
- **Professional workflow** — standard practice in the industry

## How to Connect

1. In your v0 project, look for "Sync with GitHub" or a GitHub icon
2. Click it and sign in to your GitHub account
3. Choose to create a new repository or connect to an existing one
4. Authorize v0 to push code to your repository

## What Gets Synced?

- All component code
- Styles and configuration files
- Project structure
- Changes you make in v0 are pushed to GitHub

## Basic GitHub Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Repository (repo) | A project folder on GitHub |
| Commit | A saved change |
| Branch | A parallel version of your code |
| Push | Sending changes to GitHub |
| Pull | Getting changes from GitHub |

## Tips

- Give your repository a clear name (e.g., "my-portfolio-site")
- Write short descriptions when you commit changes
- You don't need to understand Git deeply — v0 handles the hard parts

## Summary

Connecting to GitHub gives you backup, collaboration, and version control. v0 makes it easy with one-click sync. Next: deploying your project to the web.
