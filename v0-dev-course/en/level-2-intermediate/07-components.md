# Working with Components

## What Are Components?

Components are reusable building blocks of a user interface. A button is a component. A navigation bar is a component. A card showing a product is a component.

Think of them like LEGO bricks — you build pages by combining components.

## Why Components Matter

- **Reusability** — build once, use everywhere
- **Consistency** — same button style across all pages
- **Speed** — don't redesign the same thing twice

## Generating Individual Components

Instead of generating entire pages, you can ask v0 to create specific components:

- "Create a notification badge component"
- "Build a user avatar with dropdown menu"
- "Make a search bar with autocomplete suggestions"
- "Design a file upload component with drag and drop"

## Common Component Types

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Navbar | Navigation at the top of the page |
| Card | A box containing related information |
| Modal | A popup dialog |
| Form | Input fields with validation |
| Table | Rows and columns of data |
| Sidebar | Navigation on the side |
| Footer | Bottom section with links and info |

## Combining Components

You can build a full page step by step:

1. "Create a navbar with logo and menu links"
2. "Add a hero section below the navbar"
3. "Add a grid of product cards"
4. "Add a footer with social media links"

Each step builds on the previous one in the same conversation.

## Summary

Components are the building blocks of any interface. Generate them individually for more control, then combine them into full pages. Next, we'll explore design systems.
