# Knowledge Base Basics

## What Is a Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is a collection of your own documents that Nexent can search when answering questions. Instead of relying only on the AI model's general knowledge, your agent can look inside your files for precise answers.

## Supported File Formats

Nexent supports over 20 file formats, including:

- PDF documents
- Word files (.docx)
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations
- Plain text and Markdown
- Images (with OCR — text extraction from pictures)

## Creating a Knowledge Base

1. In the Nexent interface, go to the **Knowledge Base** section (usually in the sidebar).
2. Click **Create New Knowledge Base**.
3. Give it a name — for example, "Company Policies."
4. Upload your files by dragging them into the upload area.

## How It Works

When you upload a file:

1. Nexent **processes** the document — extracting text, tables, and images.
2. The text is **split into chunks** and stored in a searchable index.
3. An **automatic summary** is generated so the agent knows what's inside each knowledge base.

When you ask a question, the agent searches the knowledge base, finds relevant chunks, and uses them to compose an answer — with citations pointing to the exact source.

## Personal vs. Global Knowledge Bases

- **Personal** — only you can see and use it.
- **Global** — shared with all users in your workspace.

## Best Practices

- **Keep topics focused.** One knowledge base per topic works better than one giant collection.
- **Update regularly.** Remove outdated documents and add new ones.
- **Use clear file names.** This helps both you and the agent find the right content.

## Try It Now

1. Create a knowledge base called "Test."
2. Upload a short PDF or text file.
3. Go to the chat and ask a question about the document's content.
4. Check that the answer includes a citation from your file.

Next, we'll explore the built-in agents that come with Nexent.
