# What Is Nexent?

## Overview

Nexent is a free, open-source platform that lets you create AI assistants (called **agents**) without writing any code. You simply describe what you want in plain language, and Nexent builds a working agent for you.

Think of it as a factory for smart helpers: you tell the factory what kind of helper you need, and it assembles one — picking the right tools, knowledge, and skills automatically.

## Why Should You Care?

- **No coding required.** You describe your needs in everyday language.
- **One prompt, endless reach.** A single sentence can produce a fully working assistant.
- **Built-in knowledge.** Your agents can read your documents and answer questions about them.
- **Web search included.** Agents can also look things up on the internet for fresh information.
- **Multimodal.** You can chat with text, voice, or images.

## How Does It Work (Simplified)?

1. You open Nexent in your web browser.
2. You type a description of the agent you want — for example, *"An assistant that helps me plan trips to Europe."*
3. Nexent generates the right instructions and connects the necessary tools.
4. Your agent is ready. You can chat with it immediately.

## Key Concepts
