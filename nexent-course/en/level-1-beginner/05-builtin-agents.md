# Built-in Agents

## What Are Built-in Agents?

Nexent ships with several pre-configured agents designed for common tasks. These agents are ready to use immediately — no setup required.

## Types of Built-in Agents

### General Assistant

The default agent you've already met. It handles general questions, web search, and knowledge base queries.

### Document Analysis Agent

Specializes in reading and summarizing documents. Upload a file and ask:

> "Summarize this document in 5 bullet points."

This agent uses OCR and table extraction to understand complex documents including scanned PDFs.

### Knowledge Summary Agent

Automatically generates summaries of your entire knowledge base. Useful when you want a quick overview of all uploaded documents.

## How to Switch Between Agents

1. Look for the **Agent selector** in the top area of the chat interface.
2. Click it to see available agents.
3. Select the agent you want to use.
4. Start chatting — the agent will respond according to its specialization.
