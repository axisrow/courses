# Your First Conversation

## Opening the Chat

After installation, open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. You'll see the main Nexent interface with a chat area in the center.

## Talking to the Default Agent

Nexent comes with a built-in general-purpose agent. Simply type a message in the chat box and press Enter. For example:

> "What is the capital of France?"

The agent will respond within seconds. Behind the scenes, Nexent sends your question to the AI model you configured during setup.

## What Can You Ask?

The default agent can:

- **Answer general questions** — facts, explanations, summaries.
- **Search the web** — if web search tools are enabled, the agent will look up fresh information.
- **Analyze images** — drag and drop an image into the chat, then ask about it.
- **Generate text** — write emails, summaries, or creative content.

## Understanding the Response

Each response may include:

- **The answer** — the main text.
- **Citations** — links to sources (from the web or your knowledge base) so you can verify the information.
- **Tool usage indicators** — small labels showing which tools the agent used (e.g., "web search", "knowledge base").

## Tips for Better Conversations

1. **Be specific.** Instead of "Tell me about dogs," try "What are the best dog breeds for apartment living?"
2. **Give context.** "I'm planning a trip to Tokyo next month. What should I pack?"
3. **Ask follow-ups.** The agent remembers your conversation, so you can build on previous messages.

## Trying Voice Input

If you configured voice services during setup, click the microphone icon to speak your question. Nexent will transcribe your voice and respond.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

1. You type a message.
2. Nexent sends it to the configured AI model.
3. The model decides if it needs tools (web search, knowledge base, etc.).
4. The agent collects results and composes a final answer.
5. The answer appears in your chat with source citations.

You've just had your first conversation! Next, let's learn about knowledge bases.
