# What is gogcli?

## Overview

**gogcli** (command name: `gog`) is a tool that lets you use Google services — Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Tasks, Sheets, and more — directly from your computer's terminal (command line), without opening a web browser.

Think of it as a remote control for your Google account that you type commands into instead of clicking buttons.

## Why Would You Use It?

- **Speed**: Check emails or create events with a single command instead of navigating through web pages.
- **Automation**: Write scripts that automatically process emails, update spreadsheets, or manage your calendar.
- **Multiple accounts**: Easily switch between personal and work Google accounts.
- **Integration with other tools**: Pipe Google data into other command-line tools.

## What Can It Do?
