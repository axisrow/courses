# Testing Skills

## Introduction

A skill works only as well as it's tested.

## Manual Testing

1. **Check activation** — does the skill trigger for correct queries?
2. **Check instructions** — does Claude follow the defined process?
3. **Edge cases** — empty input, large input, invalid data

## Checklist

- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Unique name in correct format
- [ ] Description contains triggers
- [ ] Clear, unambiguous instructions
- [ ] Correct examples
- [ ] No conflicts with other skills
- [ ] Scripts work without errors

## Iteration

1. Create skill → 2. Test with 5-10 queries → 3. Find issues → 4. Refine → 5. Repeat

## Summary

- Test activation, instruction adherence, and edge cases
- Use a checklist for systematic verification
- Testing is an iterative process
