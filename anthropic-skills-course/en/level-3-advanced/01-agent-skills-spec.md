# Agent Skills — Open Standard

## Introduction

Agent Skills is an open standard defining how AI agents can use skills. The specification is at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).

## Why a Standard

Without a standard, every AI provider creates its own skill format. The standard ensures:

- **Portability** — skills work across AI systems
- **Compatibility** — skills from different authors work together
- **Ecosystem** — a common format encourages skill creation

## What the Spec Defines

1. File format — SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
2. Metadata — required and optional fields
3. Folder structure — scripts, assets placement
4. Discovery — how agents find and activate skills
5. Execution — how agents follow instructions

## Summary

- Agent Skills is an open standard for AI agents
- Ensures portability and compatibility
- Current spec at agentskills.io
- Claude's Skills is one implementation of the standard
