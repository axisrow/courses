# What Is Agentic Coding Flywheel Setup?

## What Is ACFS?

Imagine you just bought a brand-new computer in the cloud (called a **VPS** — Virtual Private Server). It's empty. No tools, no programs, nothing useful yet.

**ACFS** (Agentic Coding Flywheel Setup) is a magic installer that transforms that empty computer into a fully-equipped workshop where **AI assistants write code for you**.

### Why Should You Care?

- You don't need to be a programmer
- One command sets everything up in about 30 minutes
- You get three AI "coding agents" ready to work
- If something breaks, you just start over — it's a cloud computer, not your laptop

### The Big Picture

```
Your laptop → connects to → Cloud computer (VPS)
                                    ↓
                              ACFS installs everything
                                    ↓
                              AI agents start coding for you
```

### What Is a "Flywheel"?

A flywheel is a heavy wheel that, once spinning, keeps spinning on its own. In ACFS, each time you use the tools, you get better and faster. Your AI agents learn from past work, your workflows improve, and everything compounds.

### Key Takeaway

ACFS is a one-command setup that turns an empty cloud server into an AI-powered coding workshop. You don't need to understand programming — the AI agents do the coding.
