# Getting Your Cloud Computer (VPS)

## What Is a VPS?

A **VPS** (Virtual Private Server) is a computer that lives in a data center somewhere in the world. You rent it by the month, like an apartment. You connect to it over the internet.

### Why Use a VPS Instead of Your Laptop?

| Your Laptop | A VPS |
|-------------|-------|
| Turns off when you close it | Runs 24/7 |
| Limited power | You choose the power |
| If it breaks, your work is lost | Disposable — just create a new one |
| AI agents slow it down | Dedicated to AI work |

### Where to Rent a VPS

Popular providers:
- **OVH** — affordable European provider
- **Contabo** — budget-friendly, good specs
- **Hetzner** — excellent quality/price ratio
- **DigitalOcean** — beginner-friendly interface

### What to Choose

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 25.10 (ACFS is built for this)
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB (8 GB is better)
- **Storage**: At least 40 GB SSD
- **Cost**: Usually $5–20/month

### Step by Step

1. Go to a VPS provider's website
2. Create an account
3. Choose Ubuntu 25.10 as the operating system
4. Pick a plan with at least 4 GB RAM
5. The provider gives you an **IP address** and a **password**

### Key Takeaway

A VPS is a rented computer in the cloud. You need one running Ubuntu 25.10 to use ACFS. It costs about $5–20 per month.
