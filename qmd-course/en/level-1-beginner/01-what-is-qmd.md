# What is QMD?

## The Problem

You have notes, meeting transcripts, documentation, and knowledge scattered across many folders. Finding what you need takes forever. Regular file search only matches exact words — it doesn't understand what you *mean*.

## The Solution

**QMD (Query Markup Documents)** is a personal search engine that runs entirely on your computer. Think of it like having your own private Google, but just for your files.

QMD reads your markdown files and lets you search them in three ways:

1. **Keyword search** — finds exact words (like traditional search)
2. **Semantic search** — understands meaning (finds results even when you use different words)
3. **Hybrid search** — combines both methods for the best results

## Key Features

- **Runs locally** — your data never leaves your computer
- **Works with markdown files** — notes, docs, meeting transcripts
- **Understands meaning** — not just keyword matching
- **Works with AI agents** — designed to be used by tools like Claude

## Who Is QMD For?

QMD is perfect for anyone who:

- Takes lots of notes in markdown
- Has meeting transcripts they need to search
- Maintains documentation for projects
- Wants their AI assistant to access their knowledge base
