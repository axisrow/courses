# Best Practices & Productivity Tips

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Start with a Plan
Before asking the AI to code, describe your goal:
```
I want to build a user registration system with:
- Email/password signup
- Email verification
- Password strength validation
```

A clear plan leads to better code.

### 2. Review Everything
The AI is powerful but not perfect. Always:
- Read the generated code
- Run tests
- Check edge cases
- Understand what the code does before accepting

### 3. Use Git Religiously
- Commit before major AI changes
- Use branches for experiments
- If something goes wrong, you can always revert

### 4. Provide Context
The more context you give, the better the output:
- Use `@` mentions for files and docs
- Write clear `.cursorrules`
- Include examples of what you want

### 5. Iterate, Don't Restart
If the AI's first response isn't right:
- Tell it what to fix: "The function should also handle null values"
- Don't start over — build on the conversation

## Productivity Shortcuts

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tab completion | Writing code line by line |
| Cmd+K | Quick targeted edits |
| Chat | Complex questions and multi-step tasks |
| Agent | Building features end-to-end |
| @codebase | Finding things in your project |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Accepting code without reading it
- ❌ Giving vague instructions ("make it work")
- ❌ Forgetting to commit before big changes
- ❌ Using the AI for everything (sometimes manual is faster)
- ❌ Not updating `.cursorrules` as the project evolves

## The Right Mindset

Think of Cursor as a **very fast junior developer**. It:
- Writes code quickly
- Follows instructions well
- Needs guidance and review
- Gets better with clear context

You are still the **architect** — you decide what to build and ensure quality.

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've completed the Cursor course! You now know how to:
- ✅ Install and navigate Cursor
- ✅ Use Tab completion, Cmd+K, and Chat
- ✅ Give the AI context with @mentions
- ✅ Use Agent mode for autonomous coding
- ✅ Configure rules and work with teams

Happy coding!
