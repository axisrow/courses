# What Is Cursor?

## Welcome!

Imagine if your code editor could understand what you're trying to build — and help you write the code. That's exactly what **Cursor** does.

## The Simple Explanation

Cursor is a **code editor** (a program where you write code) that has artificial intelligence built right in. Think of it as a very smart assistant that sits next to you while you work.

It's based on **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code), one of the most popular code editors in the world. So if you've ever used VS Code, Cursor will feel familiar. If you haven't — don't worry, we'll walk through everything.

## What Can Cursor Do?

- **Autocomplete your code** — Start typing, and Cursor suggests the rest
- **Edit code on command** — Highlight code and tell the AI what to change
- **Answer questions** — Ask the built-in chat about your project
- **Write entire features** — Describe what you want, and the AI builds it
- **Find and fix bugs** — The AI can spot problems and suggest fixes

## Who Is Cursor For?

Cursor is for everyone who writes code — from complete beginners to experienced developers. Major companies like Salesforce (with 20,000+ developers) and NVIDIA use it daily.

## How Is It Different from ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a general chatbot. Cursor is purpose-built for coding. It:
- Sees your entire project
- Edits files directly
- Understands the context of your code
- Runs commands and tests

## What You'll Learn in This Course

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
1. Install and set up Cursor
2. Use AI autocomplete to write code faster
3. Have conversations with AI about your code
4. Let the AI agent build features autonomously
5. Configure Cursor for your team

Let's get started!
