# Understanding the Interface

## The Main Areas

Cursor's interface has five main areas:

### 1. Sidebar (Left)
- **Explorer** — Your project files and folders
- **Search** — Find text across all files
- **Source Control** — Git integration
- **Extensions** — Add-ons and plugins

### 2. Editor (Center)
This is where you write code. You can:
- Open multiple files in **tabs**
- Split the editor to see two files side by side
- See AI suggestions as you type (in gray text)

### 3. Chat Panel (Right)
Press `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac) to open the AI chat. This is where you have conversations with the AI about your code.

### 4. Terminal (Bottom)
Press `` Ctrl+` `` to toggle the terminal. Run commands, see output, and debug.

### 5. Status Bar (Very Bottom)
Shows useful info: current language, line number, Git branch, and your Cursor account status.
