# Installing Cursor

## Step 1: Download

1. Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Click the **Download** button
3. Cursor is available for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**

The download starts automatically for your operating system.

## Step 2: Install

### On macOS
- Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
- Drag Cursor to your Applications folder
- Open Cursor from Applications

### On Windows
- Run the downloaded `.exe` installer
- Follow the installation wizard
- Cursor will appear in your Start menu

### On Linux
- Download the `.AppImage` file
- Make it executable: right-click → Properties → Permissions → Allow executing
- Double-click to run

## Step 3: First Launch

When you open Cursor for the first time:

1. **Sign in or create an account** — You'll need a free Cursor account
2. **Choose your theme** — Light or dark (you can change this later)
3. **Import VS Code settings** — If you used VS Code before, Cursor can import your extensions and settings

## Step 4: Choose Your Plan

Cursor offers several plans:
- **Free** — Limited AI requests per month (great for trying it out)
- **Pro** — Unlimited AI features for individual use
- **Business / Enterprise** — For teams and companies

You can start with the free plan and upgrade later.

## Step 5: Verify It Works

1. Open Cursor
2. Create a new file (File → New File)
3. Start typing some code — you should see AI suggestions appearing
4. Press `Tab` to accept a suggestion

🎉 Congratulations! Cursor is installed and ready to go.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cursor won't open?** Make sure your operating system is up to date
- **No AI suggestions?** Check that you're signed in (look at the bottom-left corner)
- **Coming from VS Code?** Your extensions should work in Cursor too
