# Your First Project

## Opening a Folder

Cursor works with **folders** (also called projects or repositories). To start:

1. Click **File → Open Folder**
2. Choose an existing folder or create a new one (e.g., `my-first-project`)
3. Click **Open**

The folder appears in the **sidebar** on the left.

## Creating Your First File

1. Right-click in the sidebar → **New File**
2. Name it `index.html`
3. Start typing — you'll immediately see AI helping you

### Try This

Type the following and press `Tab` when suggestions appear:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Cursor will suggest the rest of the HTML structure. Press `Tab` to accept each suggestion.

## Saving Files

- Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (macOS)
- Or enable **Auto Save**: File → Auto Save

## The File Explorer

The left sidebar shows all files in your project:
- 📁 **Folders** — Click to expand
- 📄 **Files** — Click to open
- You can drag and drop to reorganize

## Creating Multiple Files

Real projects have many files. Try creating:
- `style.css` — for styling
- `script.js` — for code logic
- `README.md` — for project description

The AI understands how files relate to each other. When you edit `script.js`, it knows about `index.html` too.

## Opening the Terminal

Need to run commands? Open the built-in terminal:
- Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key)
- Or go to **Terminal → New Terminal**

You can run any command here — install packages, start servers, run tests.
