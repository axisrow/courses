# Choosing AI Models

## What Are AI Models?

Cursor doesn't use just one AI — it gives you access to multiple **AI models** from different companies. Each model has different strengths.

## Available Models

Cursor supports models from:
- **Anthropic** (Claude) — Great for careful, detailed code
- **OpenAI** (GPT) — Versatile and widely used
- **Google** (Gemini) — Strong at reasoning
- **xAI** (Grok) — Fast and capable
- **Cursor** — Custom models optimized for coding

## How to Switch Models

1. Open the Chat panel (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`)
2. Look at the **model selector** at the top of the chat
3. Click it and choose a different model

You can also change the default model in **Settings → Cursor → Models**.

## Which Model Should You Use?

There's no single "best" model. Here's a practical guide:

| Task | Recommended |
|------|-------------|
| Quick edits and autocomplete | Cursor's built-in model (fastest) |
| Complex code generation | Claude or GPT (most capable) |
| Understanding large files | Gemini (large context window) |
| General coding tasks | Any — try and compare |

## Tips

- **Experiment** — Try the same prompt with different models
- **Speed vs. quality** — Smaller models are faster, larger models are more accurate
- **Stay updated** — New models are added regularly; check the model list often
- **Cost** — On the Pro plan, most models are included; some premium models may count differently against your usage

## Summary

- Cursor offers multiple AI models from top providers
- Switch models easily in the chat panel
- Different models excel at different tasks
- Experiment to find what works best for your workflow
