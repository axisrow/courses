# Chat Panel — Talking to AI

## Opening the Chat

Press `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac) to open the **Chat panel** on the right side of your screen. This is where you have full conversations with the AI.

## What Can You Do in Chat?

- **Ask questions** about your code: "What does this function do?"
- **Request changes**: "Refactor the User class to use interfaces"
- **Debug problems**: "Why is this test failing?"
- **Plan features**: "How should I structure a REST API for user management?"
- **Learn concepts**: "Explain what async/await means"

## Chat vs. Cmd+K

| Feature | Cmd+K | Chat |
|---------|-------|------|
| Best for | Quick, targeted edits | Complex tasks & questions |
| Interface | Inline in editor | Side panel |
| Conversation | Single prompt | Back-and-forth dialog |
| Applies changes | Directly to code | You choose when to apply |

## Applying Code from Chat

When the AI suggests code in chat, you'll see an **Apply** button. Click it to insert the code into the right file. You can review and accept/reject the changes.

## Starting a New Conversation

Click the **+ New Chat** button to start fresh. Each conversation has its own context, so start a new one when switching topics.

## Tips for Better Conversations

1. **Be specific** — "Fix the login bug on line 42" beats "fix the bug"
2. **Give context** — "I'm building a React app with TypeScript"
3. **Iterate** — If the first answer isn't perfect, say what to change
4. **Break it down** — Ask for one thing at a time

## Summary

- `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` opens the Chat panel
- Use chat for complex tasks, questions, and debugging
- Apply suggested code with one click
- Have back-and-forth conversations to refine results
