# Team Collaboration

## Workspaces

Dify organizes everything into workspaces. Each workspace has its own apps, knowledge bases, and members.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, manage billing and members |
| **Admin** | Manage apps, knowledge, members |
| **Editor** | Create and edit apps and knowledge |
| **Viewer** | View apps and logs only |

## Inviting Team Members

1. Go to **Settings → Members**
2. Click **Invite**
3. Enter email and select role
4. Send invitation

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive app names** — "Customer Support Bot v2" not "Test"
- **Add descriptions** — explain what each app does and who it's for
- **Version your prompts** — note changes when you update prompts
- **Review logs together** — check real user conversations to improve apps
- **Separate staging and production** — use different workspaces or apps

## Sharing Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases can be shared across apps within the same workspace. This means:

- One set of company docs serves multiple chatbots
- Updates to docs automatically apply to all connected apps
