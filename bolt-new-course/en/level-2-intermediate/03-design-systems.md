# Design Systems & Styling

## What Is a Design System?

A design system is a set of consistent visual rules — colors, fonts, buttons, spacing — that make your app look professional and unified.

## Using Design Systems in Bolt

Instead of designing every element from scratch, you can tell Bolt to use a design system:

> "Use a clean, modern design system with a blue primary color, rounded corners, and the Inter font. Keep spacing generous and consistent."

## Describing Visual Style

Here are useful words to describe what you want:

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Minimal | Clean, lots of white space, simple |
| Bold | Strong colors, large text, high contrast |
| Playful | Rounded shapes, bright colors, fun fonts |
| Corporate | Professional, structured, neutral colors |
| Dark mode | Dark backgrounds, light text |

## Color Palettes

You can request specific colors:

> "Use these brand colors: primary #2563EB (blue), secondary #10B981 (green), background #F9FAFB (light gray)"

Or describe the mood:

> "Use warm, earthy colors — think coffee shop vibes"

## Typography

Ask for specific fonts or styles:

> "Use a serif font for headings and a sans-serif for body text. Make headings large and bold."

## Responsive Design

Always ask for mobile-friendly layouts:

> "Make sure the design works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Use a hamburger menu on mobile."

## Styling Specific Elements

You can refine individual parts:

- "Make the buttons larger with rounded corners"
- "Add a subtle shadow to the cards"
- "Use a gradient background for the hero section"
- "Add hover effects to all clickable elements"

## Practice Exercise

Take any project you've built and give it a complete visual makeover. Write a detailed prompt describing your desired design system.
