# Debugging & Error Fixing

## Things Will Break — And That's OK

Even with AI building your app, things sometimes don't work as expected. Bolt.new handles most errors automatically, but knowing how to deal with problems will make you more effective.

## Automatic Error Fixing

Bolt.new automatically detects and fixes about 98% of errors. When the AI generates code, it tests it and repairs issues before you even see them.

## When Something Looks Wrong

If the preview doesn't match what you asked for, simply describe the problem:

> "The navigation menu is not showing on the homepage"

> "The form submits but doesn't save the data"

> "The images are stretched on mobile"

Be specific about **what's wrong** and **where** you see the issue.

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### Layout problems
> "The sidebar is overlapping with the main content. Fix the layout so they sit side by side."

### Broken links
> "The 'About' link in the navigation goes to a blank page. Fix it."

### Data not saving
> "When I submit the form, the data doesn't appear in the list. Make sure it saves to the database."

### Styling issues
> "The text is too small to read on mobile. Make all body text at least 16px."

## Prevention Tips

- **Test frequently** — check the preview after every change
- **One change at a time** — this makes it easy to spot what broke
- **Check mobile view** — many issues only appear on small screens
- **Read error messages** — if you see a red error, copy it and paste it into the chat

## When You're Stuck

If the AI can't fix something after a few tries:

1. Try describing the problem differently
2. Ask the AI to "start this section fresh"
3. Break the feature into smaller pieces

## Practice Exercise

Intentionally ask for a complex layout, then practice fixing issues by describing problems clearly to the AI.
