# Chatting with AI to Build

## The Art of Prompting

The key skill in Bolt.new is knowing how to describe what you want. This is called "prompting." The better your description, the better the result.

## Good vs. Bad Prompts

### ❌ Too vague:
> "Make me a website"

### ✅ Clear and specific:
> "Create a restaurant website for an Italian restaurant called 'Bella Vista'. Include a homepage with a hero image, a menu page with categories (pasta, pizza, desserts), and a contact page with a map and reservation form."

## Prompt Structure

A great prompt includes:

1. **What** you're building (type of app/site)
2. **Who** it's for (audience)
3. **What sections/pages** it should have
4. **How it should look** (style, colors, mood)
5. **What it should do** (features, interactions)

## Example Prompts

### For a business landing page:
> "Build a landing page for a dog walking service called 'Happy Paws'. It should have a hero section with a tagline, a services section with three pricing tiers, customer testimonials, and a contact form. Use warm, friendly colors."

### For a simple app:
> "Create a to-do list app where users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. Use a minimal design with a white background."

### For a portfolio:
> "Build a photography portfolio with a grid gallery, an about page, and a contact form. Use a dark theme to make the photos stand out."

## Iterating on Your Design

After the first version is built, you can refine it:

- "Move the contact form above the testimonials"
- "Change the font to something more playful"
- "Add a loading animation when the page opens"
- "Make it look better on mobile phones"

## Common Mistakes

- **Asking for too much at once** — break big requests into smaller steps
- **Being too vague** — "make it better" doesn't help; say what specifically to improve
- **Forgetting mobile** — always ask for mobile-friendly design

## Practice Exercise

Write a prompt for a small business website of your choice. Include at least: the business name, 3 pages, a color preference, and 2 specific features.
