# What Is Bolt.new?

## Overview

Bolt.new is an online tool that lets you build websites and applications by simply talking to an AI assistant. You don't need to know how to code. You describe what you want in plain English, and Bolt creates it for you.

Think of it as having a professional developer on your team — one that works instantly and never gets tired.

## Who Is It For?

- **Entrepreneurs** who want to launch a product quickly
- **Marketers** who need landing pages and campaign sites
- **Product managers** who want to prototype ideas
- **Students** who want to bring their ideas to life
- **Anyone** with an idea but no coding experience

## What Can You Build?

With Bolt.new you can create:

- Business websites and landing pages
- Web applications with user accounts
- Dashboards and admin panels
- E-commerce storefronts
- Portfolio sites
- Internal tools for your team

## How Does It Work?

1. **You describe** what you want to build in a chat window
2. **AI builds** the code for you in real time
3. **You see** a live preview of your app instantly
4. **You refine** by asking for changes in plain language
5. **You publish** your app to the internet with one click

## What Makes Bolt.new Special?

- **No coding required** — just describe what you need
- **Full-stack** — it handles both the visible part (frontend) and the behind-the-scenes logic (backend)
- **Built-in hosting** — your app goes live without extra setup
- **Databases included** — store user data without managing servers
- **Automatic error fixing** — the AI tests and fixes problems on its own

## Key Takeaway

Bolt.new removes the biggest barrier to building software: the need to code. If you can describe what you want, you can build it.
