# Publishing Your First App

## Going Live

You've built your app — now it's time to share it with the world! Bolt.new makes publishing incredibly simple.

## Step 1: Review Your App

Before publishing, check your app thoroughly:

- Does every page look correct?
- Do all buttons and links work?
- Does it look good on mobile?
- Is all the text correct (no typos)?

## Step 2: Click Deploy

Find the **Deploy** button in the top toolbar. Click it, and Bolt will:

1. Prepare your app for production
2. Upload it to Bolt's hosting servers
3. Give you a live URL (like `your-app.bolt.new`)

This takes about 30 seconds.

## Step 3: Get Your Link

After deployment, you'll receive a URL. Share this link with anyone — they can view your app in their browser, on any device.

## Step 4: Test the Live Version

Open the link in a new browser tab (or on your phone) to make sure everything works as expected outside of the editor.

## Free vs. Paid Hosting

### Free Plan
- Your app gets a Bolt subdomain (e.g., `myapp.bolt.new`)
- Basic hosting included
- Good for personal projects and prototypes

### Paid Plans
- Custom domain support (e.g., `www.yoursite.com`)
- Better performance and analytics
- Priority support

## Updating Your App

Need to make changes after publishing? Simply:

1. Go back to your project in Bolt
2. Make the changes through chat
3. Click Deploy again

Your live site updates automatically.

## Sharing Tips

- Share the link on social media to get feedback
- Send it to friends or colleagues for testing
- Include it in your portfolio or resume

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've completed Level 1! You now know how to:
- Understand what Bolt.new is
- Create a project from scratch
- Write effective prompts
- Navigate the interface
- Publish a live app
