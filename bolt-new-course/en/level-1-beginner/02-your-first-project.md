# Your First Project

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll create your very first app using Bolt.new — a simple personal website.

## Step 1: Open Bolt.new

Go to [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) in your web browser. You'll see a chat input where you can describe what you want to build.

## Step 2: Sign Up or Log In

Create a free account. You can sign up with your Google account or email. The free plan lets you start building right away.

## Step 3: Describe Your Project

In the chat box, type something like:

> "Create a personal website with my name 'Alex Johnson', a short bio, a photo placeholder, and links to my social media profiles. Use a clean, modern design with a dark theme."

Press Enter and watch the magic happen.

## Step 4: Watch It Build

Bolt will start generating your website in real time. You'll see:

- The code being written on the left side
- A live preview of your site on the right side

This usually takes 30–60 seconds.

## Step 5: Make Changes

Not happy with something? Just ask! For example:

> "Change the background color to navy blue"

> "Make the font larger"

> "Add a section for my work experience"

Each time, Bolt updates the preview instantly.

## Step 6: Save Your Work

Your project is automatically saved in your Bolt account. You can come back to it anytime.

## Tips for Beginners

- **Be specific** — "A red button that says Contact Me" works better than "add a button"
- **One change at a time** — ask for changes step by step, not all at once
- **Use simple language** — you don't need technical terms

## Practice Exercise

Try creating a personal website with:
- Your name and a short description
- Three sections: About, Skills, Contact
- A color theme you like
