# Understanding the Interface

## The Bolt.new Workspace

When you open a project in Bolt.new, you'll see several key areas. Let's walk through each one.

## Main Areas

### 1. Chat Panel (Left Side)
This is where you talk to the AI. Type your requests here. Your entire conversation history is saved, so the AI remembers what you've already discussed.

### 2. Code Editor (Center)
This shows the actual code being generated. You don't need to understand it, but it's there if you're curious. You can also make manual edits if you know some code.

### 3. Live Preview (Right Side)
This is a real-time view of your app. Every change appears here instantly. You can interact with the preview just like a real website — click buttons, fill forms, navigate between pages.

### 4. File Explorer
On the left, you can see all the files that make up your project. Think of these like the pages and components of your application.

### 5. Top Toolbar
Here you'll find buttons to:
- **Deploy** — publish your app to the internet
- **Share** — get a link to show others
- **Settings** — configure project options

## Useful Actions

### Undo Changes
If you don't like a change the AI made, you can ask it to revert:
> "Undo the last change"

### Preview on Different Devices
You can switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile views to see how your app looks on different screens.

### Download Your Code
You can download all project files to your computer if you want a backup or to host it elsewhere.

## Tips

- **Use the preview** to check every change before moving on
- **Don't be afraid to experiment** — you can always ask the AI to undo
- **Check mobile view** regularly — many visitors will use phones

## Practice Exercise

Open Bolt.new, start a new project, and identify each area of the interface described above. Try switching between desktop and mobile preview.
