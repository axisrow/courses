# Custom Domains & Hosting

## Professional Web Presence

A custom domain (like `www.yourbusiness.com`) makes your app look professional and trustworthy. Bolt.new supports custom domains on paid plans.

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Buy a Domain
Purchase a domain from a registrar like:
- Namecheap
- Google Domains
- GoDaddy
- Cloudflare

Choose a name that's short, memorable, and relevant to your business.

### Step 2: Connect It to Bolt
In your Bolt project settings, add your custom domain. Bolt will give you DNS records to configure at your domain registrar.

### Step 3: Configure DNS
At your domain registrar, add the DNS records Bolt provides. This usually involves adding a CNAME or A record. It can take up to 24 hours to activate.

### Step 4: Enable HTTPS
Bolt automatically provides SSL certificates (the padlock icon in browsers), so your site is secure from day one.

## Bolt Cloud Hosting

Bolt Cloud provides enterprise-grade hosting with:

- **99.9% uptime** — your site is almost always available
- **Global CDN** — fast loading worldwide
- **Auto-scaling** — handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Built-in analytics** — see how many visitors you get

## Hosting Analytics

With Bolt's built-in analytics, you can track:
- Number of visitors
- Most popular pages
- Where visitors come from
- Device types (mobile vs. desktop)

## When to Upgrade

Consider a paid plan when:
- You need a custom domain
- Your app serves real customers
- You need better performance
- You want analytics and support

## Practice Exercise

If you have a domain, connect it to a Bolt project. If not, research domain registrars and pick a domain name for a future project.
