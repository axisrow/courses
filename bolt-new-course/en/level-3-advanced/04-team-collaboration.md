# Team Collaboration & Workflows

## Working with Others

As your projects grow, you may need to work with teammates, clients, or stakeholders. This lesson covers how to collaborate effectively using Bolt.new.

## Sharing Projects

You can share your Bolt projects with others by:
- Sending the live preview link for feedback
- Inviting team members to your workspace (on team plans)
- Exporting the code for developers to review

## Workflow for Teams

### 1. Planning Phase
- Define the project scope together
- List all required features and pages
- Assign responsibilities

### 2. Building Phase
- One person builds the initial version in Bolt
- Share the preview link for team feedback
- Collect comments and iterate

### 3. Review Phase
- Test all features thoroughly
- Check on multiple devices
- Get sign-off from stakeholders

### 4. Launch Phase
- Deploy the final version
- Set up the custom domain
- Monitor for issues

## Working with Clients

When building for clients:

1. **Start with a prototype** — show them a working version early
2. **Get feedback often** — don't build everything before asking
3. **Document changes** — keep a list of requested modifications
4. **Use the preview link** — clients can see progress in real time

## Multiplying Your Output

Agencies and freelancers can dramatically increase their output:
- Build initial prototypes in hours, not weeks
- Iterate based on client feedback in minutes
- Deliver more projects without hiring more people

## Exporting Code

If you need to hand off to a development team:
- Download the complete project code
- The code is standard and readable
- Developers can continue building on top of it

## Practice Exercise

Share one of your projects with a friend or colleague. Ask them to test it and give feedback, then make improvements based on their comments.
