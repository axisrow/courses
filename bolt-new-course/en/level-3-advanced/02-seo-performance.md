# SEO & Performance Optimization

## Why SEO Matters

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps people find your site through Google and other search engines. Without it, your beautiful app might be invisible.

## Built-in SEO in Bolt

Bolt.new includes SEO optimization features. You can enhance them by asking:

> "Optimize this website for SEO. Add proper meta titles and descriptions for each page, use semantic HTML headings, add alt text to all images, and create a sitemap."

## Key SEO Elements

### Page Titles & Descriptions
> "Set the homepage title to 'Best Italian Restaurant in Chicago — Bella Vista' and the description to 'Authentic Italian dining in downtown Chicago. Reserve your table today.'"

### Image Optimization
> "Compress all images for fast loading and add descriptive alt text to every image"

### URL Structure
> "Use clean, descriptive URLs like /menu, /about, /contact instead of /page1, /page2"

### Mobile Friendliness
Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites. Always ensure responsive design.

## Performance Optimization

Speed matters — both for users and search rankings.

### Ask Bolt to optimize:
> "Optimize the app for fast loading: lazy-load images, minimize code, and add loading indicators"

### Key performance areas:
- **Image size** — compress and resize images
- **Code splitting** — only load what's needed per page
- **Caching** — store frequently used data locally
- **Minimal animations** — keep them smooth but lightweight

## Measuring Performance

> "Add Google Analytics to track visitor behavior and page performance"
