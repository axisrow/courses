# Your First Superpowers Project

## Introduction

Building your first project from idea to working code.

## Preparation

1. Make sure Superpowers is installed (lesson 2)
2. Create an empty project folder
3. Initialize a git repository

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
git init
```

## Step 1: Describe Your Idea

Open your coding agent and describe the task:

```
I want to create a CLI utility for counting words in text files.
It should accept a file path and output word, line, and character counts.
```

## Step 2: Answer Questions

The agent will start brainstorming. Answer honestly.

## Step 3: Approve the Specification

The agent will show a design document. Read and confirm or request changes.

## Step 4: Approve the Plan

The agent creates a task plan. Review and say "go".

## Step 5: Watch Execution

The agent launches subagents. Each one:
- Writes a test
- Sees it fail (RED)
- Writes code
- Sees it pass (GREEN)
- Refactors (REFACTOR)

## Result

You'll have:
- A working CLI utility
- Full test suite
- Clean code
- Meaningful git history

## Summary

- Start by describing your idea in plain language
- Let the agent ask questions
- Approve spec and plan
- Watch subagents work autonomously
- Result: working project with tests
