# Specifications and Plans

## Introduction

How to create quality specifications and implementation plans.

## Specifications

A specification is the result of the brainstorming phase. A good spec contains:

- **Goal** — what and why
- **Requirements** — what the system must do
- **Constraints** — what the system must NOT do
- **Interface** — how the user interacts

## Implementation Plans

Plans are created by the `writing-plans` skill. Each task contains:

- Description (1-2 sentences)
- Files to modify (exact paths)
- Code (complete, not stubs)
- Verification steps

### Rules for Good Plans

- Tasks of **2-5 minutes**
- Each task is **self-contained**
- Order respects **dependencies**
- Follows **YAGNI** and **DRY**

## Summary

- Specification defines WHAT to do
- Plan defines HOW to do it
- Tasks should be small and self-contained
- YAGNI and DRY are key principles
