# Styling & Themes

Make your app look professional.

## Tailwind CSS

Lovable uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You don't need to know Tailwind — just describe what you want:

> Add more padding around the cards. Make the heading bold and larger.

## Dark Mode

> Add a dark mode toggle. Remember the user's preference.

Lovable creates a theme switcher with localStorage persistence.

## Custom Color Palette

> Use this color palette: primary #6366f1, secondary #ec4899, background #f8fafc.

## Animations

> Add a fade-in animation when cards appear. Make buttons scale slightly on hover.

Lovable uses Tailwind's built-in animation utilities or adds custom ones.

## Fonts

> Use "Inter" as the main font and "JetBrains Mono" for code blocks.

## Consistent Design

> Make all buttons rounded with consistent padding. Use the same card style everywhere.

## Design Systems

For larger apps, ask for design consistency:

> Create a consistent design system: all buttons should be rounded, use the primary color, and have hover effects. Cards should have subtle shadows.

## Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Screen |
|-----------|--------|
| sm | Mobile (640px+) |
| md | Tablet (768px+) |
| lg | Desktop (1024px+) |
| xl | Large (1280px+) |

> On mobile, stack the sidebar below the content. On desktop, show them side by side.

## Summary

Tailwind CSS powers styling in Lovable. You can control colors, dark mode, animations, fonts, and responsive behavior through natural language prompts.
