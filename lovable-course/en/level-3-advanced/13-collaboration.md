# Team Collaboration

Work together on Lovable projects.

## Sharing Projects

Invite team members to your project via the **Settings → Team** panel.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Owner | Full access, billing, delete project |
| Editor | Edit code, use prompts, publish |
| Viewer | View only, no changes |

## Working Together

- Each team member can prompt the AI independently.
- Changes are synced in real-time.
- The chat history shows who made which changes.

## Version History

Lovable keeps a history of all changes. You can:

- View previous versions.
- Restore an earlier version if something breaks.
- See what each prompt changed.

## Best Practices

1. **Agree on structure first.** Decide on pages, components, and naming.
2. **Use clear prompts.** Others should understand what you asked for.
3. **Review before publishing.** Check each other's changes.
4. **Don't prompt at the same time.** Take turns to avoid conflicts.

## Communication

Use the chat history as a log of decisions. Each prompt documents what was changed and why.

## Summary

Lovable supports team collaboration with roles, version history, and real-time sync. Coordinate with your team for the best results.
