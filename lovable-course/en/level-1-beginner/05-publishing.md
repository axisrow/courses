# Publishing Your App

Your app is ready. Let's put it online.

## One-Click Publish

Lovable has built-in hosting. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner.

Your app gets a URL like: `https://your-app.lovable.app`

## Custom Domain

Want your own domain? You can connect one:

1. Go to **Settings → Domain**.
2. Add your domain (e.g., `myapp.com`).
3. Update your DNS records as instructed.

## Sharing

Share your app link with anyone. They can use it immediately — no install needed.

## Exporting Code

If you want to take your code elsewhere:

1. Click **Export to GitHub**.
2. Lovable creates a repository with all your code.
3. You can then deploy anywhere: Vercel, Netlify, your own server.

## What Gets Exported

- React + TypeScript source code
- Tailwind CSS styles
- Supabase config (if you used a database)
- Package.json with all dependencies

## Updating After Publish

Make changes in Lovable, then click **Publish** again. Updates go live instantly.

## Summary

You can publish with one click, use a custom domain, or export to GitHub. Congratulations — you've completed the beginner level! 🎉
