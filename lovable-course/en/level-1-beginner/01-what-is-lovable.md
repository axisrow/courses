# What is Lovable?

Lovable is an AI-powered app generator. You describe what you want in plain English, and Lovable builds a working web application for you.

## Why Use Lovable?

- **No coding required.** You talk to AI, it writes the code.
- **Fast.** Build apps in minutes, not weeks.
- **Full-stack.** Lovable creates both frontend and backend.
- **Real code.** You get actual React + TypeScript code you can export.

## How It Works

1. You write a prompt describing your app idea.
2. Lovable's AI generates the code.
3. You see a live preview instantly.
4. You refine by chatting with the AI.
5. You publish or export when ready.

## What Can You Build?

## Key Concepts

- **Prompt** — your text instruction to the AI.
