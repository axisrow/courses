# Creating an Account

Let's get you set up on Lovable.

## Step 1: Go to Lovable

Open [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) in your browser.

## Step 2: Sign Up

Click **Sign Up**. You can register with:

- Google account
- GitHub account
- Email and password

## Step 3: Choose a Plan

Lovable offers a free tier to get started. You can upgrade later when you need more features.

| Plan | What You Get |
|------|-------------|
| Free | Limited prompts, 1 project |
| Starter | More prompts, multiple projects |
| Pro | Unlimited prompts, priority support |

## Step 4: Explore the Dashboard

After signing in, you'll see the dashboard. Here you can:

- **Create a new project** — start building.
- **View your projects** — see what you've made.
- **Settings** — manage your account.

## The Editor

When you open a project, you see:

- **Chat panel** (left) — where you talk to the AI.
- **Preview panel** (right) — where your app renders live.
- **Code view** — toggle to see the generated code.

## Summary

You now have an account and know where everything is. Next, we'll build your first app.
