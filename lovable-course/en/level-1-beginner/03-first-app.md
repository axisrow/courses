# Your First App

Time to build something real.

## Step 1: Create a New Project

Click **New Project** on the dashboard. Give it a name like "My First App".

## Step 2: Write Your First Prompt

In the chat panel, type something like:

> Create a simple to-do list app. Users can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. Use a clean, modern design.

Press Enter and watch the magic happen.

## Step 3: Watch the AI Build

Lovable will:

1. Generate the code (React + TypeScript).
2. Show you a live preview.
3. Explain what it built.

This takes about 30–60 seconds.

## Step 4: Try Your App

In the preview panel, interact with your app:

- Add a few tasks.
- Check them off.
- Delete one.

It works!

## Step 5: Iterate

Want changes? Just ask:

> Make the background dark. Add a counter showing total tasks.

The AI updates the app based on your feedback.

## Tips for Good Prompts

- **Be specific.** "Add a search bar at the top" is better than "make it better."
- **One thing at a time.** Small requests give better results.
- **Describe what you see.** "The button is too small" helps the AI understand.

## Summary

You built a working to-do app in minutes. You learned how to prompt, preview, and iterate. Next, we'll explore UI basics.
