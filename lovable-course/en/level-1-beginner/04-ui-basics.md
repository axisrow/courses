# UI Basics

Learn how to control the look and feel of your app.

## Layout

Lovable generates responsive layouts by default. You can ask for:

- **Single column** — simple, vertical flow.
- **Sidebar + content** — dashboard style.
- **Grid** — cards in rows and columns.

Example prompt:

> Change the layout to a sidebar on the left and main content on the right.

## Colors

Ask the AI to change colors naturally:

> Use a blue and white color scheme. Make the header dark blue.

## Typography

> Use a larger font for headings. Make the body text easier to read.

## Buttons and Forms

Lovable creates interactive elements easily:

> Add a contact form with name, email, and message fields. Add a submit button.

## Images and Icons

> Add a hero image at the top. Use icons next to each menu item.

Lovable uses popular icon libraries like Lucide.

## Responsive Design

Apps are mobile-friendly by default. You can test by resizing the preview or asking:

> Make sure the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile.

## Common UI Patterns

| Pattern | Prompt Example |
|---------|---------------|
| Navigation bar | "Add a top nav with Home, About, Contact links" |
| Card grid | "Show items as cards in a 3-column grid" |
| Modal | "Open a popup when the user clicks Edit" |
| Footer | "Add a footer with copyright and social links" |

## Summary

You can control layout, colors, fonts, and UI components through prompts. Next, we'll publish your app for the world to see.
