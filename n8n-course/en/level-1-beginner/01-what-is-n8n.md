# What is n8n?

## Introduction

n8n (pronounced "nodemation") is a free and open-source workflow automation platform. It lets you connect different apps and services together so they can work automatically — without writing code.

## Why Use n8n?

- **Save time** — Automate repetitive tasks
- **No coding required** — Use a visual drag-and-drop editor
- **Self-hosted** — Keep your data on your own server
- **Open source** — Free to use, modify, and extend
- **200+ integrations** — Connect to popular apps like Slack, Google Sheets, GitHub, and more

## How Does It Work?

In n8n, you build **workflows**. A workflow is a series of steps (called **nodes**) connected together. Each node performs an action — like reading data, sending a message, or transforming information.

Think of it like a conveyor belt in a factory: data enters at one end, gets processed at each station, and comes out transformed at the other end.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Workflow** | A sequence of connected nodes that automate a task |
| **Node** | A single step that performs an action |
| **Trigger** | A special node that starts a workflow |
| **Connection** | A link between two nodes that passes data |
| **Execution** | One run of a workflow from start to finish |

## Example Use Cases

1. **Email notifications** — Get a Slack message when you receive an important email
2. **Data sync** — Copy new rows from Google Sheets to a database
3. **Social media** — Auto-post to Twitter when you publish a blog post
4. **Backups** — Save email attachments to Google Drive automatically

## Summary

n8n is a powerful tool that helps you automate work between different apps. In the next lesson, you will install n8n and get it running on your computer.
