# What is Remotion?

Remotion is a framework that lets you create videos using code — specifically, using React, a popular tool for building websites. Instead of editing video in software like Adobe Premiere, you write instructions that tell the computer what each frame of your video should look like.

## Why Use Code to Make Videos?

Imagine you need to create 100 personalized birthday videos. Doing that by hand would take forever. With Remotion, you write the template once, feed in different names, and the computer generates all 100 videos automatically.

## Key Ideas

- **Frame**: A single image in your video. A 30-second video at 30 frames per second has 900 frames.
- **Component**: A reusable piece of your video (like a title card or an animation).
- **Composition**: The full video made up of components.

## Who Is This For?

Remotion is for anyone who wants to automate video creation. You don't need to be a professional developer — if you can follow recipes, you can learn Remotion.

## What You'll Need

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Basic comfort with typing commands
- Curiosity and patience

## Summary

Remotion turns code into video. It's powerful for automation, personalization, and creative projects.
