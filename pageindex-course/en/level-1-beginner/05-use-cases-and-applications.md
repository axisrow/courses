## Where PageIndex Works Best

PageIndex is designed for long, structured professional documents. Here are the main areas where it excels.

## Finance and Accounting

**Annual reports, SEC filings, earnings disclosures**

Financial analysts routinely work with documents that are hundreds of pages long. PageIndex can:
- Navigate directly to specific financial statements
- Find footnotes and disclosures related to specific topics
- Cross-reference information across different sections

PageIndex powered the Mafin 2.5 system, which achieved **98.7% accuracy** on the FinanceBench benchmark — a test of financial document question-answering.

## Legal

**Contracts, regulations, legal opinions**

Legal documents are often long, highly structured, and full of cross-references. PageIndex helps by:
- Understanding the hierarchy of clauses and sub-clauses
