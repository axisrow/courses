# Reading and Using Results

## Understanding the Output

When PageIndex processes a document, it produces a JSON file. Let's learn how to read and use this output effectively.

## The Output Structure

A complete PageIndex output looks like this:

```json
{
  "doc_name": "2023-annual-report",
  "structure": [
    {
      "title": "Letter to Shareholders",
      "node_id": "0001",
      "start_index": 1,
      "end_index": 3,
      "summary": "The CEO discusses key achievements and strategy..."
    },
    {
      "title": "Financial Overview",
      "node_id": "0002",
      "start_index": 4,
      "end_index": 50,
      "summary": "Comprehensive financial results for fiscal year 2023",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "title": "Revenue Analysis",
          "node_id": "0003",
          "start_index": 4,
          "end_index": 15,
          "summary": "Detailed revenue breakdown by segment and geography"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Fields Explained

### Page Indices
- **start_index**: The first page of this section (1-based)
- **end_index**: The last page of this section

These allow you to extract exactly the right pages from the original PDF.

### Node IDs
Each section gets a unique **node_id** (like "0001", "0002"). These are useful for:
- Referencing specific sections in your application
- Building links between related sections
- Tracking which sections were used to answer a question

### Summaries
The **summary** field provides a concise description of each section's content. Summaries are generated by the LLM and are essential for tree search — they help decide which branch to explore.

### Nested Nodes
The **nodes** array contains child sections. This creates the hierarchy:
- A section with no `nodes` is a leaf (the most specific level)
- A section with `nodes` is a branch that contains subsections

## Practical Tips for Using Results

### Tip 1: Navigate the Tree Programmatically

```python
import json

with open("results/document_structure.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

def print_tree(nodes, indent=0):
    for node in nodes:
        pages = f"(pp. {node['start_index']}-{node['end_index']})"
        print("  " * indent + f"- {node['title']} {pages}")
        if "nodes" in node:
            print_tree(node["nodes"], indent + 1)

print_tree(data["structure"])
```

### Tip 2: Find a Section by Topic

You can search summaries to quickly locate relevant sections:

```python
def find_sections(nodes, keyword):
    results = []
    for node in nodes:
        if keyword.lower() in node.get("summary", "").lower():
            results.append(node)
        if "nodes" in node:
            results.extend(find_sections(node["nodes"], keyword))
    return results
```

### Tip 3: Extract Pages for a Section

Once you know the `start_index` and `end_index`, you can extract those pages from the original PDF using any PDF library.

## Summary

The PageIndex output is a structured JSON tree with titles, page ranges, IDs, and summaries. Understanding this format lets you build powerful applications on top of PageIndex — from document search to automated report analysis.
