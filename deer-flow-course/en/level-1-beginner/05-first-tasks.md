# First Tasks

## Introduction

Time to practice! In this lesson, we'll complete several typical tasks with DeerFlow.

## Task 1: Topic Research

```
Research: What is WebAssembly?
Include:
1. Simple definition
2. History
3. Key advantages
4. Real-world examples
5. Future prospects
Save the result as a Markdown file.
```

DeerFlow will search the web, read multiple sources, synthesize information, and create a file.

## Task 2: Writing and Running Code

```
Write a Python program that:
1. Generates 100 random numbers from 1 to 1000
2. Calculates mean, median, and mode
3. Creates a histogram and saves it as PNG
4. Prints statistics to console

Run the program and show the result.
```

## Task 3: Working with Uploaded Files

1. Upload any PDF or text file
2. Ask:

```
Analyze the uploaded file:
- Write a brief summary (5-7 sentences)
- Highlight key topics
- Suggest 3 discussion questions
```

## Task 4: Creating a Web Page

```
Create a beautiful HTML landing page for a coffee shop called "Morning Coffee".
Requirements:
- Modern minimalist design
- Sections: hero banner, menu (5 drinks), about us, contacts
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Everything in one HTML file (inline styles)
```

## Task 5: Automation with Plan Mode

Enable Plan Mode and enter:

```
Create a mini documentation site for a fictional library "SuperCalc":
1. Home page with description
2. "Installation" page with instructions
3. "API Reference" page with 5 functions
4. "Examples" page with 3 usage examples
All pages should be linked with navigation.
```

## Tips for Effective Work

1. **Context is preserved**: within a conversation, DeerFlow remembers everything discussed
2. **Iterate**: if the result isn't perfect — ask for changes
3. **Use Plan Mode** for tasks taking 10+ minutes
4. **Upload examples**: if you need a specific style — upload a sample
5. **Check files**: created files can be downloaded through the interface

## Summary

- DeerFlow handles research, code, documents, and web pages
- Use Plan Mode for complex tasks
- Results can be iterated within a single conversation
- All created files are available for download

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed Level 1. Move on to Level 2 to learn about DeerFlow's advanced features.
