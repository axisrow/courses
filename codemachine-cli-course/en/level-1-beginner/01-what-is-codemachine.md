# What Is CodeMachine?

## Welcome!

Have you ever worked with an AI coding assistant — like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot — and found yourself repeating the same instructions over and over? Every time you start a new task, you explain the process from scratch. You guide the assistant step by step, remembering what to ask and when.

**CodeMachine solves this problem.**

CodeMachine is a free, open-source tool that lets you save your AI workflow once and run it again whenever you need it. Think of it like a recipe book for AI tasks.

## A Simple Analogy

Imagine you're a chef. Every morning, you cook the same breakfast. Without a recipe, you rely on memory — sometimes forgetting a step or an ingredient.

CodeMachine is your recipe book. You write down the steps once, and then follow them perfectly every time — or even let the kitchen cook for you automatically.

## Key Ideas

- **Workflow** — a saved sequence of steps for an AI agent to follow
- **Agent** — an AI assistant that does the work (like Claude or Codex)
- **Orchestration** — coordinating multiple agents to work together
- **CLI** — Command Line Interface, a text-based way to run programs

## What Can You Do With CodeMachine?

| Task | Without CodeMachine | With CodeMachine |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fix a bug | Explain the process each time | Run your saved "bug fix" workflow |
| Build a feature | Guide the AI step by step | Launch an automated workflow |
| Code review | Manually ask the right questions | Let a review workflow handle it |

## Summary

CodeMachine turns your repetitive AI coding processes into reusable, automated workflows. You define the steps once, and CodeMachine handles the rest.
